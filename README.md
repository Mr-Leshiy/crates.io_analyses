# Rust `crates.io` Analysis for Security and Reliability

This project is focused on analyzing Rust packages from [`crates.io`](https://crates.io) to evaluate them based on security, reliability, and other software quality metrics.
The analysis is driven by the [`cargo-deny`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) tool, which provides automated auditing capabilities for Rust dependencies.
